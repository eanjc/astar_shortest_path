# astar_shortest_path
This prolog program implements the A* (a star) algorithm. It finds the path between two cities that is the shortest and has less number of nodes (vertices)

Given a graph that represents the problem of shortest path, where nodes are cities and edges are roads, the program finds the best path.

##### How to run the program with SWI-Prolog?

?- find_shortest_path('City A','City E').

output:

The best/shortes Path is: City A, City B, City E 

The total cost of the path is: 521 kilometers

Highway to be traveled will be: N 163 - N 163

true.
